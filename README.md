# HackathonPR
Hackathon web in Bootstrap, jQuery and Asp.net 

This project is focused on strengthening and helping non-profit organizations and disadvantaged communities,
through the development and application of computer technology and entrepreneurship.
I developed a web page where users can register and log in.
On the opportunities page using Twilio the person can send messages if they have their registered number and
those messages would reach him via WhatsApp
